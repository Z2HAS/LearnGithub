# LearnGithub
This is first Step in Learning Github.
In Git to commit anything we have 2 steps a) git add b) git commit.
after firing step b the change that we made is completed.

git clone <repository link copied> -> It copies the repository and made available to see and modify in own repository
git status <Check the Status of the code>

git add <it adds the new file or changes to get staged or ready to get commited>

git commit -m "comments"<this commits the changes to origin main with comment added to keep track what we actually changed>

git push origin main<after commiting we cant see the changes that we have done locally so we push them to remote else you can type git status to check where u will find that we are ahead of origin main of what changes we did>
